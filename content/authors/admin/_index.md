Dong Ma currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science and Technology at the University of Cambridge, advised by Prof. Cecilia Mascolo. 

His research interests rotate around cyber-physical systems, including ubiquitous computing, pervasive sensing, vibration communication, energy harvesting, and mobile and wearable healthcare, covering the ene-to-end system design, implementation, and evaluation. Recently, he is particularly centred on robust human behaviour analysis and health monitoring with wearable technology and tiny machining learning on embedded devices.
